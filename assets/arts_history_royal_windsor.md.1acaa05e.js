That changed after his elder brother Prince Albert Victor died in 1892. George ascended the throne after the death of his father in 1910, serving as King of the United Kingdom and Emperor of India until his death in 1936.</p><h2 id="queen-mary-1867-1953" tabindex="-1">Queen Mary, 1867-1953 <a class="header-anchor" href="#queen-mary-1867-1953" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Queen Mary, 1867-1953&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Queen Elizabeth’s grandmother Queen Mary was royal by birth (her great-grandfather was King George III). Despite technically being a princess of the German Duchy of Teck, she was born and raised in England. She was first engaged to marry Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of Edward VII and her second cousin once removed, but after Albert’s sudden death in 1892, Mary agreed to marry his brother, the future King George V. The couple married in 1893, and had six children, two of whom would become reigning monarchs. She died in 1953, one year after her son, Queen Elizabeth&#39;s father King George VI.</p><h2 id="king-edward-viii-1894-1972" tabindex="-1">King Edward VIII, 1894-1972 <a class="header-anchor" href="#king-edward-viii-1894-1972" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;King Edward VIII, 1894-1972&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The eldest son of George V and Queen Mary, Edward became king after his father’s death in 1936, but threw the country into crisis months later when he proposed to Wallis Simpson, an American divorcée. As monarch, Edward was head of the Church of England, which at the time did not allow divorced people with a living former spouse to remarry in the church, and thus the government opposed the marriage. Unable to marry Simpson and remain on the throne, Edward abdicated in December of 1936, and was succeeded by his younger brother Albert, Queen Elizabeth’s father, who would go on to become King George VI. Edward’s reign lasted just 326 days, one of the shortest in British history. After his abdication, he was named Duke of Windsor and married Simpson in 1937. They lived abroad until his death in 1972.</p><h2 id="princess-mary-1897-1965" tabindex="-1">Princess Mary, 1897-1965 <a class="header-anchor" href="#princess-mary-1897-1965" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Princess Mary, 1897-1965&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The only daughter of George V and Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth’s aunt. During World War I, Mary devoted herself to charity work, visiting hospitals and launching fundraising campaigns to support British soldiers and sailors. She later trained as a nurse, and worked two days a week at the Great Ormond Street children’s hospital in London. In 1922, Mary married Viscount Lascelles, who later became Earl of Harewood; theirs was the first royal wedding to receive coverage in fashion magazines like Vogue. Those fans of the Downton Abbey movie will recognize Mary from her part in the plot.</p><h2 id="prince-john-1905-1919" tabindex="-1">Prince John, 1905-1919 <a class="header-anchor" href="#prince-john-1905-1919" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Prince John, 1905-1919&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The youngest child of George V and Queen Mary, John was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of four, and was sent to live at Sandringham House where he was cared for by his governess. He died in 1919 at the age of 13, following a severe seizure.

He served in the British military and had ambitions to command a regiment, but his career was interrupted by royal responsibilities following the 1936 abdication of his brother Edward VIII. He married Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott in 1935, and the couple had two sons, Prince William and Prince Richard.

In 1934, he married Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, and the couple had three children: Prince Edward, Princess Alexandra, and Prince Michael. At the start of World War II, he returned to active military service in the Royal Navy and later the Royal Air Force. His death in 1942 in a military air crash marked the first time in more than 450 years that a member of the royal family died during active service.</p><h2 id="princess-marina-duchess-of-kent-1906-1968" tabindex="-1">Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, 1906-1968 <a class="header-anchor" href="#princess-marina-duchess-of-kent-1906-1968" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, 1906-1968&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The wife of Prince George, and a princess of the Greek royal house, Princess Marina was the daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia.

The couple had three children: Prince Edward, Princess Alexandra, and Prince Michael. Following her husband’s death in 1942, Marina remained an active member of the royal family and carried out many royal duties across the world, even representing the Queen at some events.

In 1923, he married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, and the couple had two daughters: the future Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. Following Edward’s abdication in 1936, Albert took the throne and assumed the name King George VI. The dissolution of the British Empire and formation of the British Commonwealth were finalized during George’s reign, so he was both the last Emperor of India and the first Head of the Commonwealth. George died in 1952 at the age of 56, and was succeeded by his daughter.</p><h2 id="queen-elizabeth-the-queen-mother-1900-2002" tabindex="-1">Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, 1900 - 2002 <a class="header-anchor" href="#queen-elizabeth-the-queen-mother-1900-2002" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, 1900 - 2002&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was born into British nobility, the 9th of 10 siblings. In 1923, she married Prince Albert, the Duke of York, having turned down several previous proposals because she had misgivings about royal life. When her brother-in-law abdicated in 1936, Albert became King George VI and Elizabeth became the Queen consort of the United Kingdom. Upon her husband’s death in 1952, her elder daughter Elizabeth ascended to the throne, and she became known as the Queen Mother. She remained active in public life up to and even after her 100th birthday in 2000 and died at 101, seven weeks after the death of her younger daughter, Princess Margaret.</p><h2 id="prince-william-of-gloucester-1941-1972" tabindex="-1">Prince William of Gloucester, 1941-1972 <a class="header-anchor" href="#prince-william-of-gloucester-1941-1972" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Prince William of Gloucester, 1941-1972&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As the eldest son of Prince Henry and Lady Alice, Prince William was highly educated, studying at Eton College, Cambridge University, and Stanford University.

He and his wife have three children together–Alexander Windsor (1974-), Lady Davina Lewis (1977-) and Lady Rose Gilman (1980-)–and six grandchildren (Xan Windsor, Lady Cosima Windsor, Senna Lewis, Tāne Lewis, Lyla Gilman and Rufus Gilman).

As a grandchild of George V and Queen Mary, he is the Queen’s first cousin, and since his mother was a first cousin to Prince Philip, Edward is also Philip’s first cousin once removed. Edward inherited the dukedom of Kent following his father’s death in a 1942 military air crash. Nearly two decades later, he married Katharine Worsley, and the couple have three children together–George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews (1962-), Lady Helen Taylor (1964-), Lord Nicholas Windsor (1970-)–and ten grandchildren (Lord Edward Windsor, Lady Marina Charlotte Windsor, Lady Amelia Windsor, Columbus Taylor, Cassius Taylor, Eloise Taylor, Estella Taylor, Albert Windsor, Leopold Windsor and Louis Windsor).

Michael takes on fewer royal responsibilities than his siblings, but he does sometimes represent the Queen at events in Commonwealth countries outside of the United Kingdom.

In 1947, she became engaged to Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, whom she had first met at the age of 13. The couple were married the same year at Westminster Abbey, and have four children together. After her father died in 1952, Elizabeth ascended to the throne.

Because Townsend was divorced, the Church of England would not approve the marriage, and Margaret was famously forced to choose between ending the relationship and losing her royal privileges. She broke off her engagement with Townsend, and in 1960 married society photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was given the title Earl of Snowdon. The couple had two children together, and ultimately divorced in 1978 after a tempestuous 20-year marriage.
